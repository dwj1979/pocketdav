Fix the following:

ml36806:example rbastic$ curl -v -X PUT http://localhost:8081/webdav/images/hotel/foobar/test.txt --data-ascii "ohnoeszzt"

2014/11/27 00:29:12 DAV: error with create path images/hotel/foobar/test.txt
error open www/images/hotel/foobar/test.txt: no such file or directory (Mimic
nginx's implementation?)

...

Allow DELETEs to be configurable -- they would be logged, but maybe not actually executed sometimes.

...

Create a large-scale test suite
